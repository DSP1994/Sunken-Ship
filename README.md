In HEROKU after creating the account:

"Create new App"

Give the App a unique name and enter region

Click on "Create App"

Click on "Settings" on your new App Dashboard

Scroll down to Config Vars where in my instance I only inserted KEY: PORT and VALUE: 8000 since I have no creds.json files to add.

Press Add-button

Scroll down to Buildpacks and press the icon for Python, click Save Changes, then press the icon for Nodejs and save changes. These Buildpacks need to be in below order:

Python NodeJS

Go to Deploy section tab and scroll down to Deployment Method. I connected to my Github pages and could thereafter search for my Github Repository "Parents Allowance Calculator" and then click connect.

Scroll down to Automatic and Manual Deploys sections. I clicked on Automatic Deployment so that my changes that I push to github automatically updates in Heroku.

Then in the Manual Deploy section, press Deploy Branch.

After project has been deployed successfully I clicked the View-button to see the program run in the terminal.
